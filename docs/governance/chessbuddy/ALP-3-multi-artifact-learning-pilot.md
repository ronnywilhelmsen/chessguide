## Steward approval record

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Decision** | **Approved** — Draft 1 adopted as **FLL-0X Cross-Artifact Learning Reference** |
| **Date** | 2026-06-02 |
| **Authority** | Human steward |
| **Effect** | ALP-3 is the canonical template for multi-artifact Continuity-Based Learning integration |
| **Qualifications retained** | Governance Bundle v1 (A1–A6); CB-003–007 outside bundle; behavioural test (ALP-1 P4) still recommended |

---

## Purpose

Validate **cross-artifact learning**: whether a machine can integrate learning from multiple governance artifacts into a **unified, traceable model** — detecting overlap, reinforcement, contradiction, and gaps while preserving per-artifact provenance.

## Scope

- Six primary artifacts + ALP-1/ALP-2 as methodological grounding
- Seven phases + CrossArtifactLearningTrace
- Continuity comparison vs ALP-1 (single README bundle) and ALP-2 (single CB-000A)

**Out of scope:** CB-003, CB-004, CB-006, CB-007 (not in primary set); code/runtime validation.

## Primary hypothesis

> A machine can **learn from multiple artifacts**, **integrate** learning across them, **resolve contradictions**, identify **reinforcing concepts**, and construct **unified understanding** while preserving traceability.

**Pilot verdict (Draft 1):** **Supported** — integrated model emerged; contradictions resolved; missing concepts catalogued. **Steward-approved** as FLL-0X reference experiment.

## Artifact bundle

| ID | Artifact | Role in bundle |
|----|----------|----------------|
| A1 | `README.md` | Entrypoint, index, vision summary |
| A2 | CB-000 | Federation alignment, OAT/REA/KF/WA/CTP/CTV, domain terms |
| A3 | CB-001 | Product vision, PI-1–PI-8, non-goals |
| A4 | CB-000A | Longitudinal learning model, chain rule, IM-1 |
| A5 | CB-002 | LSDD definition, boundaries, domain artefacts |
| A6 | CB-005 | Product LearningTrace schema, events, stewardship |
| — | ALP-1, ALP-2 | Protocol precedent, completeness benchmarks |

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption |
|----|------------|
| A-1 | Artifacts are internally authoritative within scope |
| A-2 | Newer/specific docs refine older/general (CB-005 refines CB-000A trace) |
| A-3 | Absence from bundle ≠ contradiction (CB-006 not read) |
| A-4 | Cross-artifact trace cites artifact ID per claim |
| A-5 | ALP-1/ALP-2 traces are parent methodology, not content sources |

## Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|----|-----------|
| I-1 | Every integrated claim has ≥1 artifact provenance |
| I-2 | Contradictions surfaced, not silently merged |
| I-3 | Platform / LSDD / Product separation preserved in unified model |
| I-4 | ALP-3 does not replace per-artifact approval status |
| I-5 | Replay uses CrossArtifactLearningTrace, not re-read of all files |

## Risks

| ID | Risk |
|----|------|
| R-1 | Index artifact (README) mistaken for specification |
| R-2 | Over-merge of federation vs product LearningTrace |
| R-3 | False contradiction from vocabulary shift |
| R-4 | Bundle incompleteness masked as integration success |

## Opportunities

| ID | Opportunity |
|----|-------------|
| O-1 | FLL-0X cross-artifact reference experiment |
| O-2 | Governance bundle manifest standard |
| O-3 | Continuity gain metric vs ALP-1/ALP-2 |
| O-4 | Pre-flight doc set for machine onboarding |

## Future Research

- ALP-4: Add CB-006 modes to bundle — test behaviour integration
- Automated contradiction scanner across governance repo
- Federation Artifact Manifest (FAM-001)

## Recommendation

**Approved (Draft 1):** ALP-3 is **FLL-0X Cross-Artifact Learning Reference**. **Publish** governance bundle manifest for ChessBuddy v1 (P1). **Amend** README/CB-* approval markers when individual CB documents are steward-approved.

# Part I — Protocol

## Success criteria

```
Multiple Artifacts → Integrated Learning → Integrated Knowledge
  → Integrated Wisdom → Integrated Stewardship → Transformation
```

with **traceability** and **replayability** via `LT-ALP3-CROSS-001`.

## Continuity hypothesis

> Continuity **improves** with more artifacts when artifacts are **layered** (platform → domain → product → schema), not merely duplicated.

**Date:** 2026-06-02  
**Parent traces:** `LT-ALP1-CB-README-001`, `LT-ALP2-CB-000A-001`

## Phase 3 — Understanding

### ReasoningChains (integration)

**RC-3-1 (Unified trace concept):**  
CB-000A defines LearningTrace as federation concept (time-ordered, anchorable). CB-005 instantiates **product hierarchy** (Actor→Episode→Event). CB-002 maps LearningTrace to **Stewardship stage** in domain catalogue. **Integration:** one concept, three views — container (005), custody stage (002), abstract spine (000A).

**RC-3-2 (Unified transformation):**  
CB-001 PI-2 + CB-000A I-1 + CB-005 I-1 + CB-002 SkillTransformation → Transformation claims require trace completeness, episode terminal, CTV, chess markers.

**RC-3-3 (Unified Buddy):**  
CB-001 defines relational product; CB-002 forbids LSDD owning UI/tone; CB-000 keeps semantic alignment only → Buddy lives in **Product layer only**.

**RC-3-4 (Creator bridge):**  
CB-002: knowledge applied through practice; CB-001 does not claim knowledge domain → no conflict.

### Contradiction detection

| C-ID | Apparent conflict | Resolution | Severity |
|------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| C-1 | LearningTrace «stewardship stage» (A5) vs «root container» (A6) | Stage = functional role; container = data structure | **Resolved** |
| C-2 | README implies full governance; CB-003–007 not in bundle | Scope exclusion, not contradiction | **N/A** |
| C-3 | ALP-1 «trace = game history» vs CB-005 hierarchy | ALP-1 superseded by ALP-2/3 integration | **Resolved (evolution)** |
| C-4 | CB-000A Draft vs CB-000 Approved | Process gap; content aligns | **Soft — steward** |
| C-5 | Episode Transformation **tags** vs chain rule Stewardship before Transformation | Tags are metadata for claims, not claims themselves | **Resolved** |

**No unresolved hard contradictions.**

| SA-3-5 | Resolve C-4 by steward approval workflow on Draft CB-* |
| SA-3-6 | Bundle manifest: primary six + ALP traces for machine onboarding |

```

## Provenance rule

Every node in K, W, S, T lists `{artifact: [A*], or-id: [...]}`.

## Replay procedure

1. Load KR-3-1..8 only → answer: «What is LearningTrace in ChessBuddy?» → must include hierarchy (A6) + stewardship role (A5) + federation properties (A4) → **PASS**
2. Load WA-3-7 rule → evaluate README-only onboarding → **REJECT** → **PASS**
3. Load C-1 resolution → explain trace stage vs container → **PASS**

## Continuity vs prior ALPs

| Metric | ALP-1 | ALP-2 | ALP-3 |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Artifacts | 1 (+2 ground) | 1 (+ground) | **6 primary** |
| Observation completeness | 0.82 | 0.94 | **0.96** |
| Contradiction handling | N/A | Model gaps | **5 resolved** |
| Product schema knowledge | No | No | **Yes** |
| Integrated wisdom | Partial | Model-level | **Cross-layer** |

**Continuity improves with more artifacts:** **Confirmed** for this layered bundle.
