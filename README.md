# ChessBuddy

**A personal chess mentor** — a learning companion that observes, understands, explains, guides, and validates **skill development over time**.

## What is ChessBuddy?

ChessBuddy is **not** an online chess server, a raw engine, or a tournament platform. It is a **Buddy**: present at the board, respectful of your autonomy, and focused on your longitudinal journey — especially during **friendly and physical** play with a clock beside the board.

The legacy application provides opening hints, engine suggestions, game history, and clock information. The product is now governed and evolved toward a clear vision under the **Federated Continuity Architecture**.

## Federation alignment

ChessBuddy is a domain within the **Federated Continuity Architecture**, alongside Creator, BioChronos, Finkairos, Domosofi, and Laris.

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Longitudinal Learning Platform** | Federation-wide architecture for learning over time |
| **Longitudinal Skill Development Domain** | ChessBuddy’s federation identity — learning through **skill** |
| **ChessBuddy Product** | User-facing mentor and companion |

ChessBuddy may serve as the federation’s first **practical validation domain** for the learning chain: Reality → Observation → Attention → Understanding → Knowledge → Wisdom → Stewardship → Transformation.

## Product vision (summary)

Per [CB-001 — Product Vision](docs/governance/chessbuddy/CB-001-product-vision.md):

- **Users:** Players who want to improve over time — not only chase rating on a global arena.
- **Problem:** Tools capture moments; ChessBuddy captures the **journey**.
- **Difference:** Lichess and Chess.com ask who wins; Stockfish asks what is best; ChessBuddy asks **what you learn and how you transform**.
- **Invariant:** Engine is reference; the player owns their history; the Buddy explains before it dictates.

> *ChessBuddy is your personal chess mentor — present at the board, remembering your journey, explaining what you need to understand, and helping you see that you are actually improving over time.*
